# horiseon-code-refactor

## Description 

This is a refactor of the Horiseon website. This project was built so that that the Horiseon website follows accessibility standards so that people with diabilities can access the website using assistive technology. Another motivation behind this project was to ensure that the website is optimised for search engines like Google. Both the HTML and CSS have been updated to meet both accessibility standards and SEO requirements.
